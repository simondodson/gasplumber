There are many gas hot water systems and brands in the Australian market. Each of these has its pros and cons based on reliability, effectiveness, quietness, price, value for money, ease of use, after-sales service, and overall satisfaction. It is always good for potential buyers of such products to check their reviews from guides like CHOICE and on opinion sites such as Canstar Blue and ProductReview.com. This will help you to decide if you want a gas, solar, or electric hot water system that uses a storage tank or is instantaneous, if it will be stored indoors or outdoors, and its energy rating, among other attributes.

Additionally, the reviews posted by different users on such guides allow potential buyers to discern the best brands for hot water systems as rated by users in the Australian market. It is however important for consumers to understand that the first decision to make when selecting a hot water system is to decide if it will be a heat pump, electric, solar, or gas-powered system. It is only after this that they can evaluate the other attributes of the specific brands.

ProductReview.com offers ratings on various innovative products. For example, the Dux Prodigy gas hot water storage system was awarded a 4-star rating in a review on ProductReview.com and it was ranked high in temperature consistency, value for money, heating speed, noise level, cleaning and maintenance, and on build quality. Some review comments for the product were positive while others were negative. However the best hot water system is different for different people depending on their situation. It can be a gas, solar, continuous hot water, or instantaneous hot water system but it should satisfy particular customers’ needs. Natural gas boosted solar storage hot water systems cost the cheapest over time, while LPG and continuous flow electric systems are the most expensive. Water heating accounts for 25% of a typical household’s energy use, so it is important to select the hot water system that will provide the most cost savings. In addition, items like freezers and dishwashers are used regularly, so buyers should ensure they select durable but efficient and affordable products, depending on their needs. ![download--19-](https://web.archive.org/web/20210303114519im_/https://gasplumbersbrisbane.com.au/content/images/2021/02/download--19-.png)

Water heating also generates a large quantity of greenhouse gas emissions. Electric water heaters in particular contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions. This means that using a shower that uses electricity is more costly for environmental sustainability than using a gas or solar-based shower system. To ensure you select the best possible hot water system, many gas fitters and plumbers stock a wide range of hot water systems form different brands. They also use certified and specialized plumbers and gas fitters to install gas, heat pump, electric, and solar water heaters. It is therefore important that when you book such a specialist, you ask a lot of questions pertaining to different brands so that you can have an idea of the capabilities of the different products. Hot water systems are available from brands such as Rheem, Bosch, Dux, Solahart, Rinnai, and Vulcan. In spite of varying pros and cons among the brands, the Rinnai tankless hot water system is considered among the best in the market after Solahart and Vulcan, based on overall satisfaction, effectiveness, value for money, after sales service, reliability, quietness while operating and ease of use.

The above mentioned brands offer competitive products and prices that might excite buyers but also confuse them when they make a selection, because some of the brands are rated almost similarly. However, it is important to evaluate the brands carefully, to understand their ongoing running costs, and find out how each brand is rated based on the factors mentioned previously and thus their suitability for specific households. As previously noted, water heating significantly affects the environment and also increases consumer bills in households. Therefore, one of the best ways to reduce energy bills is to reduce hot water consumption because continuous use of hot water or installation of the wrong hot water system will consume a large portion of a household’s electricity. Various energy-efficient gas, electric, solar, and heat pump hot water systems can be directly compared to others of similar fuel type so as to gauge energy efficiency. This is because the government has put in place rating standards such as MEPS and gas star ratings that quickly inform users about the quality and attributes of a product. However, the ratings are not practical for comparing between different fuel types. For instance, electricity and gas ratings cannot be effectively compared on a one-on-one basis. It therefore takes a discerning and patient consumer to take the time to critically evaluate the various brands before settling on a specific brand that meets all their needs.
