Portable and flued heaters are a common and necessary feature in any home as they help to quickly warm spaces in a home. However, first-time users need to consult experts in order to obtain guidance on heating costs, installation, prices, and the pros and cons of the different types of heaters. Customers must initially understand how much space they are heating because the measurement of a gas heater’s warming capacity is not only about the room size but also about how quickly the heater warms the space. However, all heater models sold in Australia have to be certified and carry an efficiency label, so this ensures that customers get high quality products. Additionally, water heating in homes is common and uses energy sources such as electricity, gas, solar, natural gas, and LPG. Each water-heating fuel source has its pros and cons, so users must carefully evaluate them before making a decision.

Reducing hot water use and using renewable energy sources help to reduce environmental impacts, and by installing efficient indoor or outdoor water heaters for a household size and changing water use patterns, individuals can save money and reduce GHG emissions. LPG heaters are a better alternative to natural gas models. It is however important to select LPG appliances that are approved as safe for use in Australia. This ensures users select models that deliver warmth effectively but safely. Users should also learn how to troubleshoot basic heating problems, such as increasing the thermostat temperature during winter months to fix temperature issues, and flushing the heater annually to reduce noise form heaters.
